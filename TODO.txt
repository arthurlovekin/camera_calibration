TODO: 
1. Calibrate from file 
2. Intrinsic calibration using GUI
    Add buttons using opencv camera callbacks 
    (I explored using async Python to take commands from the terminal, 
    but it's too complicated for my taste compared to using the opencv mouse callback
    to get the interactivity. Unfortunately OpenCV doesn't provide keypress callbacks, 
    only the WaitKey)
    GUI needs major improvements
3. Stereo calibration
4. Extrinsic Calibration
